### Structure

<img align="right" width="130" height="250" src='./pictures/components.png'>

1. index 
2. App
    - Aside
        - search
        - filter
        - favourite
        - extra info
    - Main
        - character cards
        - adding your own character
<br>

### Building Process
- First I started by creating the wireframe to visualise what I want the outcome to look like.
- I set up my components and created a static version of the app.
- Then I created a function for each of these components.
- Afterwards I added a bit of styling.

## Challenges
This is my very first React Project so building something from scratch itself was a pretty big challenge itself.

- I had to draw a 'tree' of the components to visualise where to place each function. 
- I find it challanging to think about setting states and using these to make certain elements work on the app but eventually I put something together.

<br>

## Key Learning
1. I need to focus executing a code and not spending hours on what would be the best practice. Then when it is working focusing on how to make it more officiant.

2. I need to learn to step away from the screen and take breaks because it is crucial for my brain to be able to function well throughout the week so I will not burn out in 48 hours.

3. If you canâ€™t find the answer written online then try asking teachers or peers before watching hours and hours worth of videos on Youtube just to end up asking a human about your problem.

## Future Improvements 
- Adding local storage
- Making the website responsive with a better layout
- Adding new background picture when the favourite button is pressed
- Adding option to choose your character picture
- Adding an all button
- Adding pagination to be able to display all characters

<br>

## Bugs
- The search and filter components work seperatly 
- You have to re fresh the page every time you want to go back to the 9 main randomly displayed pictures.
